## Notes on Assembly Language.

- Some differences between Linux/*BSD/illumos ASM programming.
- illumos ASM is poorly documented.
- FreeBSD provides good documentation so far.
- Some items to note:
  - Intel syntax
    mov dst, src
    int 80H
  - AT&T syntax
    mov src, dst
    int 0x80
  - Linux/*BSD/illumos use AT&T syntax.
  - Syscalls widely differ i.e. int 0x80 on Linux is int $91 on illumos.
  - pushl is widely used on illumos to set base-pointer.
- Took a slight detour and built a cross-compiler on Debian using instructions
  from [http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler]
- Located under /opt/cross.
- Working on [http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones]
  - Hello, World kernel booted.
  - boot.s to set registers, memory and stack.
  - kernel.c to print string.
  - linker.ld to link object files created.
  - Runs in qemu using `qemu-system-i386 -curses -cdrom myos.iso`.
  - Need to pick through the source and document what the source does exactly.
