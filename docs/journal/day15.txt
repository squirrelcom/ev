Now that a basic Makefile is created, I can move on the next task which is to
pull out the write functionality to an internal __write() function. 

The function itself is protoyped in system.h and defined in system.c. The idea
for the bootup process is to initialize the console (paint it black) and then
call __write() to print output to screen. The current way to do it is to call
the console_char() function which iterates over each character one-at-a-time
and writes them to the framebuffer.

I have created the following three functions:

__strlen() - calculate length of character string.
__write_char() - write character to console.
__write() - write string to console.

These have been separated out in to different source files, system.c and
system.h. I have also moved some standard definitions to console.h to keep
the init_kernel.c file clean.
