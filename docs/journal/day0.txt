This is a small journal used to keep track of my progress in learning OS design 
and development.

The first two tasks that need to be done (apart from a mountain of reading), are
setting up a development environment and booting a simple "Hello, world" program
in assembler.

For a development environment I am using a Joyent zone on SmartOS. I hope to 
utilize DTrace and mdb if that is even possible.
