Assembly Language

- Endianness
  - lsb is at lowest offset.
  - msb is at highest offset.
- lsb at lowest offset is Little Endian. Read right to left.
- msb at lowest offset is Big Endian. Read left to right.
- Translator: generate machine instructions that CPU can understand.
- Compiler: reads language source files and writes out object code files.
- Assembler: translates assembly language into object code.
- Assembly has mnemonics to help programmers write instructions. For example the
  mnemonic for binary instruction 9CH is PUSHF.
- mnemonics work with operands to carry out tasks (load digits, count etc) and
  taken together, a mnemonic and its operand are called an instruction.
  Example:
      mov ebp,esp    ; Save the stack pointer in ebp or 8BH ECH in machine 
                       instruction
- Steps for assembling and linking:
  - Create .o object file.
  - Link and create executable.
    - To build the executable, the linker firsts builds an index called a sumbol
      table, which contains an entry for every named item in every object module
      it links. Each entry has information about what name (symbol) refers to 
      what location within the module.
    - Relocatability: Variables in a program are not located at a particular
      physical address, but are located at an offset from the beginning of the
      file.
