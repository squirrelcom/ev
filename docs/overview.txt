### Overview

ev intends to become a small Unix-clone operating system. Self contained with 
its own userland applications, it will be somewhat similar to *BSD or illumos.

### An Operating System

The internals of an operating system are vast and complex. The current range
of operating systems available run on a large codebase comprising of hundreds
or thousands of developers. Due to constrained resources, ev will be minimal at
best, hopefully similar in vain to Minix or xv6 (one day..).

At its heart, an operating system generally carries out the following:
* Process management
* Scheduling tasks
* Manage memory
* Manage hardware resources including disks, network and graphics cards
* Filesystem management
* Network communication
* Signal processing

These activities are managed by the kernel which forms the core of the operating
system. 

### Development Process

Due to the size of ev, the design will be simple to begin with, using the 
notes found under the documentation/journal/ directory to track.
